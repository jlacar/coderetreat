# Global Day of Code Retreat

Welcome!

Get ready for a full day of practice. Today is your chance to get better at the craft of software development. Today is all about *you*, the programmer. No managers breathing down your neck, no commitments to break, no estimates to pull out of the air or your you know what. Just pure, unadulterated practice and hopefully, a lot of fun and learning.

At GDCR, you will get a chance to practice Test-Driven Development (TDD), pair/mob programming, refactoring, unit testing, and applying design principles. You'll also get to meet other people just like yourself, who are passionate about programming and being the best they can be at their craft.

## It's about Craftsmanship

If you have had bad experiences with Scrum or some other flavor of Agile Software Development in the past, you might hesitate when you hear "TDD, refactoring, and pair programming" and say, "Wait, are you trying to trick me into doing Agile?"

No, Code Retreat is not about Agile Software Development at all, although you'll probably meet some  participants of Code Retreat who practice or are interested in Extreme Programming (XP). No, Code Retreat is about practicing the *craft* of writing software.

## Code Retreats are FREE!

Code Retreats are free of charge and usually organized by developers for developers. Of course, organizations are encouraged to sponsor these events to provide a venue and facilities and most important, food and drinks for the participants. Pizza and energy drinks, maybe some beer afterwards, are recommended but anything that will help get us through the day is fine.

## A Very Brief History of GDCR

The original idea for code retreat came out of conversations that Corey Haines had with Gary Bernhardt, Nayan Hajratwala and Patrick Welsh at the 2009 Codemash conference in Sandusky, Ohio. The first ever Code Retreat was held in January 2009 in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The first Global Day of Code Retreat was held in 2011. The rest, as they say, is history. If it's still too early for you to do the math, that makes this year's (2017) event the 7th annual GDCR.

## Unsolicited Plug

If you're looking for some reference material for Code Retreat, your best bet would be Corey Haines' book, *Understanding the Four Rules of Simple Design*, which he published on LeanPub in 2014. This little book weighs in at around eighty pages but is arguably one of the best books you'll find about Test-Driven Development and simple design. Corey explains some of the most important lessons learned from observing thousands of participants in many code retreats all over the world.

If you're thinking of either facilitating or participating in a Code Retreat, this book is your User Guide. I don't get anything from promoting this book other than the comforting thought that by doing so, it could lead someone somewhere to write better code that I just might someday have the pleasure of reading or working on.

## The Goal of Code Retreat

The goal of Code Retreat is pretty simple: to write perfect code. To this end, we take away one of the things that often prevents us from writing perfect code: the need to be done.

At past code retreats, Corey Haines has explained it like this (paraphrased):

If all you have at the end of the day is one line of code, as long as that line of code is perfect, then you will have achieved the goal of a code retreat.

In our daily work, we often make compromises, take shortcuts, and not do some of the things we know we should do like write more unit tests and refactor more. We write code on a daily basis that is less than perfect because we are under pressure to finish and move on to the next task. But because we take shortcuts so we can be done, our code is a little harder to work with, understand, and change than it would be if we had more time to make it perfect.

There is always a gap between what we imagine to be "perfectly written code" and how we actually write code on a daily basis. It's important that we have that gap because if we spent all our time trying to write perfect code on the job, we'd get very little, if anything, done! That gap, however, is also a measure of how much we suck.

Our aim at Code Retreat is to narrow that gap, even just a little bit. Not close it up entirely, but maybe just make it a little smaller in the hope that what we learn during this one day of perfect, no-pressure-to-finish practice can be brought to bear on our day-to-day coding.

Hopefully, by practicing how to write perfect code, we can take some of the things we learn and raise the bar in our daily work just a little bit. Then maybe we'll find it easier to choose better names, or write more unit tests, or recognize code smells, or refactor more, or do something better that makes the code we write at work suck less.

## The Guidelines

To practice writing perfect code, we need to have a standard of perfection. At GDCR, that standard is codified in the Four Rules of Simple Design. Code that follows these rules have the following characteristics:

1. Passes all tests
2. Expresses intent clearly
3. Contains no duplication
4. Small

Because we need all tests to pass, we need to have tests. Automated unit tests, that is, because manual tests just won't cut it when you only have forty-five minutes to write some perfect code. Because our code needs to express our intent clearly, contain no duplication, and be small, we need to refactor.

Test-Driven Development integrates writing unit tests and refactoring in very tight minutes-long cycles. This is why we do TDD at Code Retreat.

TDD is really effective when you communicate and exchange ideas with others. This is why we do pair or mob programming at Code Retreat.
