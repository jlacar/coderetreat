# Global Day of Code Retreat

Welcome!

Get ready for a full day of practice. Today is your chance to get better at the craft of software development. Today is all about *you*, the programmer. No managers breathing down your neck, no commitments to break, no estimates to pull out of the air or your you know what. Just pure, unadulterated practice and hopefully, a lot of fun and learning.

At GDCR, you will get a chance to practice Test-Driven Development (TDD), pair/mob programming, refactoring, unit testing, and applying design principles. You'll also get to meet other people just like yourself, who are passionate about programming and being the best they can be at their craft.

## A Very Brief History of GDCR

The original idea for code retreat came out of conversations that Corey Haines had with Gary Bernhardt, Nayan Hajratwala and Patrick Welsh at the 2009 Codemash conference in Sandusky, Ohio. The first ever Code Retreat was held in January 2009 in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The first Global Day of Code Retreat was held in 2011. The rest, as they say, is history. If it's still too early for you to do the math, that makes this year's (2017) event the 7th annual GDCR.

In 2013, Corey Haines wrote a book, *Understanding the Four Rules of Simple Design*, and published it on LeanPub. This little book is arguably one of the best books from which to learn Test-Driven Development and simple design. In it, Corey explains some of the most important lessons learned from observing thousands of participants in many code retreats all over the world.

## The Goal

The goal of GDCR is pretty simple: to write perfect code. To this end, we take away one of the things that often prevents us from writing perfect code: the need to be done.

At past code retreats, Corey Haines has explained it like this (paraphrased):

If all you have at the end of the day is one line of code, as long as that line of code is perfect, then you will have achieved the goal of a code retreat.

In our daily work, we are often make compromises, take shortcuts, and not do some of the things we know we should do like write more unit tests and refactor more. The code we write on a daily basis is less than perfect because we need to be done and move on to the next task.

There is always a gap between what we view as "perfect code" and what we write on a daily basis. It's important that we have that gap though because we can't spend all our time trying to write perfect code on the job. If we did that, we'd get very little, if anything, done! That gap, however, is also a measure of how much we suck.

Our aim at GDCR is to narrow that gap, even just a little bit. Not close it up entirely, but maybe just make it a little smaller in the hope that what we learn during this one day of perfect, no-pressure-to-finish practice can be brought to bear on our day-to-day coding.

Hopefully, we can take back some of the things we learn at GDCR and raise the bar in our daily work just a little bit. Then maybe we start choosing better names, or write more unit tests, or get better at recognizing code smells and refactoring, or do something better that makes the code we write at work suck less.

## The Guidelines

To practice writing perfect code, we need to have a standard of perfection. At GDCR, that standard is codified in the Four Rules of Simple Design. Code that follows these rules have the following characteristics:

1. Passes all tests
2. Clearly expresses intent
3. Contains no duplication
4. Small
