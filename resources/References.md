# References for learning TDD and practicing at Coderetreat

The following are references I have used in learning how to do Test-Driven Development more effectively. This is
far from being a comprehensive list but it's good enough to get you started getting familiar with all the things 
I think you should know if you're going to do TDD the way it's meant to be done.

If you're going to attend a Coderetreat, I highly recommend the first book listed below: Corey Haines' little ebook (it's 
less than 90 pages long and it's only available on LeanPub as far as I know) about Kent Beck's Four Rules of Simple Design. 
It's all about Conway's Game of Life, the problem we practice on at Coderetreat, and the different ways you can approach 
the problem and solution.

I hope you find these useful. I did.

Have fun practicing and crafting!

## Books

### Test-Driven Development and Design

* [*Understanding the Four Rules of Simple Design*](http://leanpub.com/4rulesofsimpledesign) by Corey Haines

> Corey Haines started Coderetreat in 2007 with a few other folks who attended CodeMash. This book contains many of the
> lessons learned from facilitating hundreds of coderetreats. One of the best books to learn TDD that isn't explicitly
> about TDD. Highly recommended if you're planning on attending a Coderetreat or if you just want to learn how to think 
> more mindfully about design. 

* [*Test Driven Development: By Example*](https://amzn.to/2OaFBFH) by Kent Beck

> Kent Beck demonstrates how he does TDD. Enough said.

### Refactoring

* [*Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code (2nd Edition)*](https://amzn.to/2qhD4zU) by Martin Fowler

> The long-awaited update to the original book. Fully revised and updated to include new refactorings and code examples.
>
> "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand." —M. Fowler (1999)

* [*Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code*]( https://amzn.to/2Ssgt0b) by Martin Fowler

> The first edition, published in 1999. This is the book that blew my mind after I read the first chapter. 
> It lists twenty-two code smells and seventy-two refactorings.

* [*Working Effectively with Legacy Code*](https://amzn.to/2JloeAZ) by Michael Feathers

> Also known as "the WELC book," this is an indispensable reference for anyone who has to work with code that doesn't have 
> tests, is difficult to work with, and difficult to change. Discusses characterization testing, dependency breaking 
> techniques, techniques for safely making changes to code, and many more. 
>
> "... *legacy code* is simply code without tests. Code without tests is bad code... With tests,
> we can change the behavior of our code quickly and verifiably. Without them, we really don't
> know if our code is getting better or worse." —Michael Feathers

* [*Refactoring to Patterns*](https://amzn.to/2yGFRXV) by Joshua Kerievsky

> Contains the Compose Method refactoring example that I use to show how refactoring can make a dramatic difference
> in the clarity and readability of code.

### Unit Testing

TBD

### Agile Software Development / Extreme Programming

* [*Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change (2nd Edition)*](https://amzn.to/2Oct18U) by Kent Beck (2004)

> Updated to organize and present five years' worth of experiences, growth, and change revolving around XP.

* [*Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change*](https://amzn.to/2Jnzs82) by Kent Beck (1999)

> Considered by many as the Manifesto for Extreme Programming. This book and Fowler's *Refactoring* were an epiphany
> for me and started me on my journey to agility. 

* [Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns, and Practices*](https://amzn.to/2SpVivM) by Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin

> Extensive discussion of SOLID design principles, TDD, and Agile.

### Software Craftsmanship / Programming Practices

* [*Clean Code*](https://amzn.to/2EQQEnS) by Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin

> The software craftsman's field guide to writing good code.

* [*Clean Architecture*](https://amzn.to/2SrQ1Uz) by Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin

* [*The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master*](https://amzn.to/2D8OVIT) by Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt

> This book introduced the DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself). The authors are also original signatories of the 
> Manifesto for Agile Software Development.

* [*Effective Java (Third Edition)*](https://amzn.to/2Q2sKH4) by Joshua Bloch
